        title: "How I Think About Healthcare Innovation",
        content: [
            "My thinking about healthcare innovation was shaped during early clinical immersion in a NICU. I remember a distressed parent repeatedly asking for updates about a critically ill newborn. At first glance, it appeared to be a communication gap. But deeper observation revealed something structural: the system was optimized for treatment execution, not for information transparency.",
            "Clinical data existed. Monitors were active. Decisions were being made. Yet there was no mechanism to translate complex physiological signals into structured, interpretable information for non-clinical stakeholders. That experience taught me discipline. Emotional intensity does not automatically justify product development. If a problem cannot survive ecosystem scrutiny, stakeholder incentives, workflow constraints, liability risk, economic viability, it does not deserve to become a device.",
            "At a technical level, my instinct always begins with signal reliability. Before thinking about interfaces or AI layers, I interrogate the measurement itself. Is the biological signal stable? How do melanin and hemoglobin interfere? Does the signal vary across anatomical sites? What is the impact of motion artifact or phototherapy? Is the signal-to-noise ratio defensible? If the signal foundation is weak, no amount of algorithmic sophistication can compensate.",
            "In healthcare, trust is engineered, not assumed. It is built when biological validity, interpretability, workflow alignment, and regulatory foresight converge. I design from the signal outward, aligning biology, clinical reality, economics, and human experience into scalable, defensible medical systems."

With 5+ years of experience building AI-driven MedTech products, I specialize in taking ideas from 0 → 1 — transforming complex clinical challenges into validated, deployable solutions.",
            "Trained in the IIT–AIIMS Joint Doctoral Programme in Medical Technology, I developed deep clinical immersion within tertiary hospital settings. Collaborating closely with clinicians, nurses, biomedical engineers, and administrators, I gained a systems-level understanding of healthcare workflows, enabling me to design products grounded in real-world constraints, not assumptions.",
            "I have led the end-to-end development of multi-signal wearable devices and intelligent diagnostic platforms, from problem discovery and roadmap definition to prototyping, clinical validation, and regulatory strategy (FDA/CDSCO). My work has secured $72,000+ in funding as translational grants, generated 6 intellectual properties, and improved device accuracy by over 20% through AI/ML optimization significantly influencing treatment decisions.",
            "I think beyond features, balancing usability, safety, scalability, regulatory alignment, and commercial viability. My mission is to build ethical, data-driven healthcare products that create measurable impact, especially in diverse and resource-constrained settings."
